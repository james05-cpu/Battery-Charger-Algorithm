When the diode is conducting, the diode current is given by:  

 ID(t)=(VS(t)-VB-Vr)/R
 The voltage across the diode is: 
VD(t)=Vr

Non-Conducting Mode 

When the diode is not conducting: 
The magnitude of the reverse voltage is given as: |VR(t)|=|VS(t)|+VB
and the diode current:  ID(t)=0
The conduction cycle can be described as the period from when the diode starts 
conducting to the time when the diode stops conducting over one cycle of the input signal.
